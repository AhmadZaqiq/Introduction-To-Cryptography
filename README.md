# Introduction-To-Cryptography

## This code implements a simulation for testing the randomness of a sequence of bytes generated using the RC4 encryption algorithm. It performs pattern occurrence analysis, Chi-square tests, and P-value calculations to evaluate the randomness of the generated bytes. The simulation checks if the occurrence of specific bit patterns in the byte stream is consistent with expected values, using statistical tests to determine if the sequence appears random.
